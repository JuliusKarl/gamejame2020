This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Current Balance

**Health** Starts at 15. Win by getting your own tower to 30. Can't go lower than 0.

**Order of play** Start with 5 cards. Play one card each turn, then draw

## Card Ideas

_italicised == shelved for now_

- Randomise towers among players
- Set all towers to the lowest on the board
- Trade towers with another player.
- Undo the effect of the last turn
- Discard your entire hand and inc/dec any tower by that much.
- _Draw 2 cards_
- _Play two cards this turn, at the cost of skipping your next turn_
- +1, unless +7 or more has been played since your last turn, in which case it's +7
- Reset all towers to 15
- _Skip this turn. For the rest of the game, all your decs will be one stronger._
- Start as +1. Increase by one for every round.
- _Peek at the top 3 cards on the deck._

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
